# WP Post Exporter

## What is it?

This is a plugin to allow you to export your WordPress posts, allowing for a fine selection of fields to include, in a variety of formats like: CSV (currently supported), JSON, plain text, etc.

## Where is the importer for migrations?

The plugin is not concerned with data migration between WordPress installs, there are other plugins more suited for that. Use this to extract specific portions of data in a way that fits external needs (e.g. loading on a spreadsheet).
